**Introduction**

The gemstone price prediction project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the price of gemstones based on various attributes. The data includes factors such as carat, cut, clarity, and color, all of which influence the gemstone price. The project explores several models, performs feature engineering, and evaluates the models using R² and RMSE as evaluation metrics.

**Technologies and Tools**

Programming Language: Python
**Libraries:**
Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
Data Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib
Machine Learning Models: Scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost
Other Tools: Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and model evaluation

**Dataset:**

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and consists of 53,940 rows and 10 attributes, including:

Features: Carat, Cut, Clarity, Color, Depth, Table
Target: Price (the price of the gemstone)
Carat values range from 0.2 to 5.01, and prices vary from $326 to $18,823.

**Implementation Steps:**

**Data Preprocessing:**

*Imported and cleaned the dataset.
*Handled missing data and standardized numerical features.
*Applied one-hot encoding to categorical features (e.g., Cut, Clarity, Color).

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Visualized feature distributions and relationships using histograms and box plots.
Identified the most influential features, such as Carat and Clarity.

**Model Training:**

Implemented and trained six models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, XGBoost, and LightGBM.
Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

**Hyperparameters used:**
Random Forest: 100 trees, max depth = 10.
XGBoost: learning rate = 0.1, max depth = 6, estimators = 200.
KNN: neighbors = 5, Euclidean distance metric.

**Results:**

**Model Evaluation:**

Metrics: R² (explained variance) and RMSE (error).
Best Model: LightGBM achieved an R² of 0.98 and RMSE of 534.54.

**Model Comparison:**

Linear Regression: R² = 0.91, RMSE = 1178.89
Decision Tree: R² = 0.96, RMSE = 741.47
Random Forest: R² = 0.94, RMSE = 900.45
XGBoost: R² = 0.96, RMSE = 720.50
LightGBM: R² = 0.98, RMSE = 534.54 (Best Performance)

**Future Work**
**Scalability:**

Integrate real-time pricing data.
Adapt the model for predicting prices of other luxury goods.

**Feature Enhancements:**

Incorporate external factors such as market trends, gemstone origin, etc.

**Applications:**

Develop a pricing tool for traders, auction houses, and customers in the gemstone market.

**Optimization:**

Refine hyperparameters and enhance the model for commercial deployment.
